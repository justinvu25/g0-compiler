Project Proposal 3/3

Topic is ok, but the proposal should be more concrete on what can be
implemented by goroutines. For example, the scanner can be, what about other
parts? Can you compile procedures in parallel? Can the symbol table be a
goroutine?

Project Artifacts:

Good work, though some more research and experimentation with what can be
parallelized best might have given different results. In the poster, be more
specific about the of the code samples, the percentage of comments, white
space etc., as otherwise there is no explanation for the differences. A better
comparison may be Go with concurrency vs Go without concurrence, to take into
account that you had to reimplement the compiler differently. Can you add this?
